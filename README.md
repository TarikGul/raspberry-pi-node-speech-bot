# My Raspberry PI project.

## PART 1 - Weather BOT

Theres a lot going on with this one.

The first part though I am building a alexa style PI that will tell me all the 
weather information per day.

Note if you want to run or test this out yourself you must get a weathermap key;

We are using text to speech, I want to first make it tell me the weather first thing when I wake up,
and then I want it to add sensors to it, so the first time it sees me move in the day it will autmatically 
tell me my first weather response of the day. 

[X] Build external weather api call

    [] Ordered
        [] Adafruit I2S 3W Class D Amplifier Breakout - MAX98357A Kit

        [] jumper cables

- I have ideas for this, but not totally sure yet what or how i want to implement them
- More on this once I finish the actual weather BOT
